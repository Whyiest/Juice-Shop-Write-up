### Security Recommendations

- **Use Strong Security Questions**: Avoid questions that can be answered through public or easily accessible information. Instead, use questions that have subjective or less predictable answers.
- **Don't use Security Questions**: Best security practice is to not use security questions for ressettings password, but rather send an email to user to confirm that he want to change his password.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to strengthen the account recovery process, reducing reliance on security questions alone.
